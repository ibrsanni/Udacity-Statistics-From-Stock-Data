### Statistics from Stock Data
This project involves analyzing stock data using the Pandas library in Python. The goal is to calculate summary statistics and create visualizations to gain insights into the data.

### Project Files
The project files include the following:

* _stock_datas_: This are the three(_.csv files_) dataset containing the stock data.
* _stats of stock data.ipynb_: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for analyzing the stock data.

### Project Steps
The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Cleaning: The stock data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and any missing or inconsistent values are handled.
2. Summary Statistics: Measures of central tendency (mean, median) and measures of spread (standard deviation, range) are calculated for the quantitative variables in the dataset.
3. Data Visualization: Visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and box plots are created to explore the data and gain insights.

### How to Run the Code
To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
2. Download the project files from the repository.
3. Open the stats of stock data.ipyn in Jupyter notebook or any other Python environment(e.g: _code_).
4. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and generate the analysis results.
5. View the presentation.pdf file to see the slide show presentation.
